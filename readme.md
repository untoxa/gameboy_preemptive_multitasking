Preemptive multitasking example for GAME BOY
--------------------------------------------

Written in SDCC. Supervisor is a small asm routine driven by timer interrupt. 
You can simply create, terminate, join and destroy threads, like you do it in 
windows, linux or other with a help of a very similar API and patterns.

No practical purpose, made just for fun and to practice in C.
